This project is an implementation of 






(a) IcosahedronMesh.m, TriQuad.m, SubdivideSpherical is from Anton Semechko 's code:
        http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37004-uniform-sampling-of-a-sphere
    The code is for creating an icosahedron and then subdivide it many times, sample usage:
    
    >> TR = IcosahedronMesh     % return a TriRep class, which will be removed from Matlab in near future
    TR = 
      TriRep
      Properties:
                    X: [12x3 double]
        Triangulation: [20x3 double]
      Methods
    >> figure, h=trimesh(TR); set(h,'EdgeColor','b'), axis equal    % visualize base icosahedron with 12 points and 20 faces
    >> figure, h=trimesh(SubdivideSphericalMesh(TR, 1)); set(h,'EdgeColor','b'), axis equal % after 1 time of subdivision, each face now become 4 faces
    >> figure, h=trimesh(SubdivideSphericalMesh(TR, 2)); set(h,'EdgeColor','b'), axis equal
    >> figure, h=trimesh(SubdivideSphericalMesh(TR, 3)); set(h,'EdgeColor','b'), axis equal
    >> figure, h=trimesh(SubdivideSphericalMesh(TR, 4)); set(h,'EdgeColor','b'), axis equal

    The coordinates of uniformly distributed points is saved in TR.X, there are also many other available properties and functions for your needs.
    
(b) nearestneighbour.m is from Richard Brown's code:
        http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12574-nearestneighbour-m
    The code is for finding the k nearest neighbours in any dimension, i use it to find the nearest icosahedron vertice given a raw light direction

(c) shapeletsurf.m, grad2slanttilt.m, needleplotst.m are from Peter Kovesi's code:
        http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~pk/Research/MatlabFns/
    The code is for surface reconstrution based on normals, basically is to get the depth information of each pixel, i use it to view the stereo result.
    There is a shapletTest.m file to test the usage of the shapeletsurf lib.
    
(d) gco3.0 library if from 
        http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/
    it's a wrapper of many codes which are contributed by many people, including a matlab implementation. I use it for the refinement of normals.
